This is my experiment/version/whatever of a genetic based learning algorithm inspired directly by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A01_aKgIeCo) Using
the olc::PixelGameEngine from [One Lone Coder](https://community.onelonecoder.com), another great [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).

The [Nature of Code](https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/nature-of-code/) from The Coding Train breaks down many of the techniques here, check it out.
